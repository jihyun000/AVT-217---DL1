	<h2>Summary on my research</h2>
	<div id="summary"><p>I picked two websites that looks really professional and clean to me, which are <a href="https://www.darvishi.ca/">A. Darvishi's Portfolio</a> and <a href="https://www.robert.irish/">Robert Irish's Portfolio.</a>The both sites use photographs of themselves. A. Darvishi uses linked photos to show visitors and clients about his skills, and <em>Rober Irish</em>uses simple navigation buttons on the header

	<h2>My Design</h2>
	<div id="mysite"><p>Similar to those, I would like to create my portfolio websites like a minimalist. I would create navigation lists of, "illustration", "comics", "product design", "about" and "contact". Those navigation lists are going to be linked with each html files. Under the header section with navigation lists, there would be linked image boxes that represent what my skills are.
