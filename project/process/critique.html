<h1>5 Portfolio Websites</h1>

<h2>Stefanie Brueckler</h2>

<p>The website is very simple, fancy, clean, and photographic. There are a number of portfolio pages with different photos. Photographs look like fashion magazine’s. The website is good at using negative space. Tilted angles in photographs make the website more interesting. Short animations, maybe gif, are used as well. Use of color contrast, angles, and simplicity are charming.</p>


<h2>Heather Shaw</h2>

<p>The most interesting part of this site is how it looks like a company or a corporate website. Photographs are faded with different colors before clicking them, but it would look better without those colors. Enough margin area helps explanatory texts to stand out. Sizes and colors for texts are easy to read.</p>


<h2>MDZ Design</h2>

<p>The first impression on the website wasn’t good. It’s hard to recognize that it’s a designer’s portfolio website. Photographs have weak connections to each other as if it’s random photos. Explanation on each project helps potential clients or visitors understand what the designer did and brief process of the project.

<h2>Christ Tammar</h2>

<p>Good use of mock ups. Simple layout and simply white background. I wish there are more explanatory texts in project pages. Sizes for images look good, but size for the text is small.</p>


<h2>Mingfei Yang</h2>

<p>Black and white. The website is simply representing the artist. On top, there are titles for pages like, “Project”, “Professional Works”, “Personal Works”, etc so that it’s convenient to locate the artist. I wish those texts were thicker and a little bit bigger. Change on the juxtaposition of images would make the site visually interesting, and make images on center.
